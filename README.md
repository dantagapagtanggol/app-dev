The *Unlimited Blade Works* chant: Archer and Shirou's clash is a breathtaking combination of philosophy and raw power.

```text
"I am the bone of my sword.
Steel is my body, and fire is my blood.
I have created over a thousand blades.
Unknown to death, nor known to life.
Have withstood pain to create many weapons.
Yet, those hands will never hold anything.
So, as I pray, Unlimited Blade Works."
